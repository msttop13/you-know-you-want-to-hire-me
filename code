I am Torin Collins, a bright young woman studying Computer Information Systems and Economics at Howard University. My interests lie in UX Design, analytics and content development. I am an excellent communicator, team player and critical thinker. I bring passion and optimistic energy to any team and love a good challenge. I've worked with big 4 accounting firm KPMG as an intern in their advisory practice and served as team lead for various projects throughout my undergraduate studies. I'm dope. This is a small snippet of my self wrote at 2AM the night before my midterm, but I am definitely worth the risk.
